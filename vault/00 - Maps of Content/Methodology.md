# Second Brain Structure Methodology

This file contains information on how notes should be created and stored within this Obsidian Vault.

## Organizational Philosophies

In this vault I try to following the below philosophies:

### PARA

Organization structure based on actionability and relevance to your goals.

- **Projects**: Notes directly tied to active projects or deliverables with a clear goal and deadline.
- **Areas**: Ongoing responsibilities or themes that require continuous management or reference.
- **Resources**: General knowledge, inspiration, or references that support Projects or Areas.
- **Archive**: Completed or inactive notes and projects for reference only.

## Zettelkasten

Note-taking and knowledge management system designed to help organize and interconnect ideas

- **Fleeting Notes**: Temporary notes for capturing quick thoughts, ideas, or observations.
- **Literature Notes**: Summaries and insights drawn from specific sources (books, articles, podcasts, etc.).
- **Permanent**: Timeless, standalone notes that capture a refined idea or concept.

1. Start with **Fleeting Notes** to capture ideas quickly.
2. Process and refine them into **Literature Notes** when studying materials.
3. Distill and connect the most significant insights into **Permanent Notes** to build your knowledge base.

Miscellaneous:

- **Unique IDs**: Notes are given unique identifiers, making them easy to reference and organize.
- **Links Between Notes**: Notes are connected to related notes, creating a web of ideas.

## Folder Structure

- **00 - Maps of Content**: This folder contains information about the content of this vault.
  - Note: If needed [[09 - Reference/Obsidian/README|Obsidian Info]] contains information about the technical details of this vault.
- **01 - Global**: This folder contains overarching themes of the vault which surpass any individual note. Current use case is goals.
- **02 - Notepad**: This folder acts as **Fleeting** from the [[Methodology#Zettelkasten|Zettelkasten]] note-taking method. Any quick note or idea should be written down here.
- **03 - Queue**: This folder is similar to **Notepad** however these notes are meant to be organized later, thus this folder should be empty at the end of each day
- **04 - Daily**: This folder contains daily notes. Daily notes are meant to keep track of what I achieved each day, kind of like a journal. These also should reference goals and progress made to each goal.
  - Daily notes should not be used as a scratch pad or random thoughts
- **05 - Literature**: This folder contains notes of books, videos, podcasts, articles, GitHub repos, etc. These can be synthesized to form resources or act as references for Areas and Projects.
- **06 - Projects**: This folder acts as **Projects** from [[Methodology#PARA|PARA]]. Tasks with which I create or items with end dates should be included here.
- **07 - Areas**: This folder acts as **Areas** from [[Methodology#PARA|PARA]]. Areas are ongoing fields of exploration and learning.
- **08 - Resources**: This folder acts as **Resources** from [[Methodology#PARA|PARA]]. This folder is for knowledge based information.
- **09 - Reference**: This folder contains useful information for specific matters, not knowledge base.
- **10 - Archives**: This folder contains items which are no longer relevant, but I may become or be useful in the future.
- **11 - Overflow**: This folder contains items which are no longer relevant and will almost certainly not be relevant in the future.
  - May be combined with **Archives**
